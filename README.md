# Parsing-of-The-Documents-and-Extracting-the-Data
Developed a Python-based system to automate structured data extraction from PDF documents. Implemented regular expressions to accurately identify and categorize invoice and acknowledgment numbers, storing the extracted data in a PostgreSQL database to enhance data management efficiency and accuracy.
